<p> Hi, my name is Isaac Velasquez!</p>
<p> I did my undergrad at Princeton University for Computer Science where I
was mentored by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mzweaver/">Matthew Weaver</a>
in Homotopy Type Theory; my interest first being piqued as a result of the field
existing at the intersection of philosophy, foundations of math, and computer science.
I am now a first-year at the University of Minnesota, advised
under <a href="https://favonia.org/">Favonia</a>. The following are a few of the interests that I hold and that I might touch upon in my various blog posts</p>
<ul>
  <li>Homotopy Type Theory</li>
  <li>German Idealism (Specifically, Phenomenology)</li>
  <li>Theology (Neo-Orthodoxy and Liberation Theology)</li>
  <li>FOSS</li>
  <li>Video Games</li>
  <li>Soccer (USA, Ecuador, El Salvador, Brazil || Club: Liverpool, Leicester)</li>
</ul>
