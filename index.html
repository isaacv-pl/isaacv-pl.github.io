<h2>Isaac Velasquez</h2>
<p><b>velas129[at]umn[dot]edu</b></p>

<p> I did my undergrad at Princeton University for Computer Science where I
was mentored by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mzweaver/">Matthew Weaver</a>
in Homotopy Type Theory; my interest first being piqued as a result of the field
existing at the intersection of philosophy, foundations of math, and computer science.
I am now a first-year Doctoral Candidate at the University of Minnesota in the Computer Science department, advised
under <a href="https://favonia.org/">Favonia</a>. The following are a few of the interests that I hold and 
that I might touch upon in my various blog posts in the near future.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Homotopy Type Theory</li>
  <li>German Idealism (Specifically, Phenomenology)</li>
  <li>Theology (Neo-Orthodoxy and Liberation Theology)</li>
  <li>FOSS</li>
</ul>
<h3>Announcements</h3>

  <li>Presented my Senior Thesis at HoTT MURI <i>Fall 2021</i> </li>
